Stop-and-Wait Protocol:

The Stop-and-Wait protocol is a simple flow control protocol for point-to-point communication systems. 
In this protocol, the sender sends a single packet of data and waits for an acknowledgement from the receiver before sending the next packet.

The implementation of the Stop-and-Wait protocol using Python sockets involves the following steps:

    Create a socket object using the socket module in Python.
    Define the IP address and the port number that the socket will listen on.
    Bind the socket to the IP address and the port number.
    Listen for incoming connections using the listen method.
    Accept a connection using the accept method. 
    This returns a new socket object and the address of the client that has connected to the server.
    Define the data to be sent.
    Send the data using the send method of the socket object.
    Receive the acknowledgement from the receiver using the recv method of the socket object.
    Close the connection using the close method of the socket object.

The program that I provided implements the Stop-and-Wait protocol using Python sockets. 
It creates a server that listens for incoming connections, accepts a connection from a client, sends a single packet of data, 
waits for an acknowledgement from the client, and then closes the connection. 
The program uses the encode and decode methods to convert the data between bytes and string representations.
